                    About Kyra Young
                </h2>
                <p class="bioBody">
                    Kyra is a 30 year old web professional that has studied at Mid-State Technical College. While in college
                    she tutored other students. Outside of an academic setting, Kyra was a security guard with Per-Mar Security.
                    Her professional passions include learning, connecting with other professionals in her industry, and encouraging people
                    to proceed with their academic adventure.
                    <br>
                    Outside of a professional setting she is passionate about mental health topics. She believes that everyone deserves the right to be
                    of a healthy mind. She also loves watching cheesy horror films with her two cats, Senna and Sword of Damocles. She has been teaching
                    herself how to crochet since 2020 at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then she has gone on to produce many projects, such
                    as the UWSPDuckGirl project. She would crochet rubber duck dolls and hide them around campus, and give students encouraging messsages.
                    Thanks to multiple attempts of encouragement from her loving partner, Alison, she has rediscovered her love for reading.
                    <br>
                    In the future she hopes to become more involved with local politics, focusing on LGBTQIA+ community. As a Transgender person she
                    believes that feeling safe in their communities is a fundamental right for all people. She also wishes to engage more with the homeless
                    communities in her current town of Stevens Point, to try and provide better aid and support for affected individuals.
